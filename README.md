# the weakness that need to work on: 
Yassine find him self confusing while trying to use the gained knowledge to build a certain project, So He need to work as well as possible building stuffs to cover this problem.
Maybe his side work (as a photographer) make him distructing a litte bit, But he trying to find a balance.
